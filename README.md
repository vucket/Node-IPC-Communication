# Node-IPC-Communication Example
This is a basic server/client IPC communication between two files using Node 10.12.0.
The client side has uses a CLI tool to connect and disconnect from the server, get and set the data of the server's device.

First you must install all the dependencies with ``` yarn install ```.

Then you have to start the server with:
```
npm run start-server
```
In a separate terminal you can start a client:
```
npm run start-client
```
